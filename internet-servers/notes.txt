- Separated by layers -
1) link - logical network component to interconnect nodes, furthest element from the user,
2) internet - determines how to transport data from one link to another, sets the destination for info sent 
3) transport - cuts up data into pieces called packets, determines how the data is to be sent and reconstructed. 
TCP ports determine these defaults - 16 bit ports. Only one app can be listening on a given ports 

- In terminal -
host <website name> - provides ip address and domain information 
whois <website name> - provides information about the author and organisation

- Connecting server to client -

SERVER
const net = require("net"); // built in module on node that is used for creating TCP servers 
const server = net.createServer(function(socket){  
    // takes in callback function 
    // is an event listener - event listener is a function that will trigger on a specified event
    // "socket" argument is an objet that represents a connection

    socket.on("data") <- detects data from client (.write(data))

    socket.on("end") <- detects data end from client
    }

CLIENT
client.on("data") <- takes data from server (.write(data))
client.connect(port, address (){ <- writes data to server
    function 
})
